Reference documentation for the [HTTP Archive](https://httparchive.org/) dataset on BigQuery.

## Contributing

These docs are powered by Starlight by Astro.

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
