[`httparchive.all.pages`](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1shttparchive!2sall!3spages) is a partitioned and clustered table containing one row per page tested in the HTTP Archive. Pages are tested on a monthly basis and as of April 2022, both the root page and one secondary page are tested.

## Example queries

Here are some common operations you can perform with the `pages` table.

### Get the median page weight

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Query">

```sql
/* This query will process 1.12 GB when run. */
WITH pages AS (
  SELECT
    client,
    CAST(JSON_VALUE(summary, '$.bytesTotal') AS INT64) AS page_weight
  FROM
    `httparchive.all.pages` TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1 PERCENT)
  WHERE
    date = '2023-05-01'
)

SELECT
  client,
  APPROX_QUANTILES(page_weight, 1000)[OFFSET(500)] AS median_page_weight
FROM
  pages
GROUP BY
  client
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Results">

client | median_page_weight
-- | --
mobile | 1776291
desktop | 2029751

The median mobile page weighs 1.78 MB and the median desktop page weighs 2.03 MB.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This query uses the [`APPROX_QUANTILES`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/approximate_aggregate_functions#approx_quantiles) function to calculate the median page weight for each client type as of May 2023.

The `bytesTotal` property of the `summary` object represents the total number of bytes loaded on the page. This value is stored as a JSON-encoded string, so we use [`JSON_VALUE`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions#json_value) to extract it and [`CAST`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/conversion_functions#cast) to convert it to an integer.

We're also using the [`WITH`](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax#with_clause) clause here to create a temporary table called `pages`, which is then fed into the main query below. This makes the query a bit easier to read.

Also note that for demonstration purposes, this query processes a 1% sample of the `httparchive.all.pages` table. This reduces the amount of data processed by the query, which can help reduce costs. But note that the results will be less accurate than if you ran the query on the full table.

### `date`

**This field is required for all queries over the `pages` table.**

YYYY-MM-DD format of the HTTP Archive monthly crawl.

  Example: `date = '2023-06-01'`

### `client`

Test environment: `'desktop'` or `'mobile'`.

### `page`

The URL of the page being tested.

Example: `page = 'https://har.fyi/'`

### `is_root_page`

Whether the page is the root of the origin.

### `root_page`

The URL of the root page being tested, the origin followed by `/`.

Example: `root_page = 'https://har.fyi/'`

### `rank`

Site popularity rank, from CrUX

### `wptid`

ID of the WebPageTest results, for example `wptid = '230509_Dx20W_FMHK5'`.

The ID encodes the date of the test at the start in YYMMDD format. The date is followed by an underscore and a `D` or `M` character indicating whether it was a desktop or mobile test. The rest of the ID is randomly generated. In the example above we can tell that the page was tested on May 9, 2023, and that it was a desktop test.

You can view the WebPageTest results in the browser by visiting `https://webpagetest.httparchive.org/result/<wptid>/`, eg https://webpagetest.httparchive.org/result/230509_Dx20W_FMHK5/. This isÂ HTTP Archive's own private instance of WebPageTest, which is required to view any of the results.

### `payload`

JSON-encoded WebPageTest results for the page.

For a full example value, see [payload.json](/payload.json).

See the [`har`](/reference/blobs/har/) reference for more details.

### `summary`

JSON-encoded summarization of the page-level data

### `custom_metrics`

JSON-encoded test results of the custom metrics.

See the [`custom metrics`](/reference/structs/custom-metrics/) reference for more details.

### `lighthouse`

JSON-encoded Lighthouse report.

See the [`lighthouse`](/reference/blobs/lighthouse/) reference for more details.

### `features`

Blink features detected at runtime (see https://chromestatus.com/features)

### `technologies`

Technologies detected at runtime (see https://www.wappalyzer.com/)

See the [`technology`](/reference/structs/technology/) reference for more details.

### `metadata`

Additional metadata about the test

See the [`metadata`](/reference/blobs/page-metdata/) reference for more details.
