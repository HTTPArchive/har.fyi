import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

[`httparchive.crawl.requests`](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1shttparchive!2scrawl!3srequests) is a partitioned and clustered table containing one row per request per page tested in the HTTP Archive. Pages are tested on a monthly basis and as of April 2022, both the root page and one secondary page are tested.

## Example queries

Here are some common operations you can perform with the `requests` table.

### Count the pages crawled

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Query">

  ```sql
  /* This query will process 85 GB when run. */
  SELECT
    client,
    is_root_page,
    count(0) AS requests_total
  FROM `httparchive.crawl.requests`
  WHERE date = '2024-05-01'
  group by client, is_root_page
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Results">

  client | is_root_page | requests_total
  -- | -- | --
  mobile | true | 1517364094
  desktop | true | 1299394354
  mobile | false | 1216156430
  desktop | false | 1093804725

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Size of requests served

Let's check the size of individual requests served from websites across the entire dataset. To do this, we'll be using the respBodySize summary metric. This metric represents the size of the response payload in bytes. Since 1 byte is very granular, we'll divide by 1024 to get to 1 KB and then by 100 so that we are looking at this data with bin sizes of 100KB. We'll also wrap this in a CEIL() function to remove the decimal points and then multiply the result by 100. Using this technique, 1234567 bytes would be rounded to a bin of 1300 KB.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Query">

  ```sql
  /* This query will process 26 GB when run. */
  WITH requests AS (
    SELECT
      CEIL(INT64(summary.respBodySize)/1024/100)*100 AS responseSize100KB,
      COUNT(0) OVER () AS total_requests
    FROM `httparchive.crawl.requests` TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1 PERCENT)
    WHERE
      date = '2024-06-01' AND
      client = 'desktop' AND
      is_root_page AND
      INT64(summary.respBodySize) > 0
  )

  SELECT
    responseSize100KB,
    COUNT(0) AS requests,
    COUNT(0)/ANY_VALUE(total_requests) AS pct_requests
  FROM requests
  GROUP BY responseSize100KB
  ORDER BY responseSize100KB ASC
  LIMIT 10
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Results">

  responseSize100KB | requests | pct_requests
  -- | -- | --
  100.0 | 10113115 | 0.90864138408777051
  200.0 | 486257 | 0.043689133714228209
  300.0 | 188335 | 0.016921490072264605
  400.0 | 87127 | 0.0078281714260556891
  500.0 | 54134 | 0.004863822144433972
  600.0 | 37443 | 0.0033641721017113315
  700.0 | 26985 | 0.0024245435505883687
  800.0 | 19817 | 0.0017805143428575023
  900.0 | 24519 | 0.0022029788147814046
  1000.0 | 11787 | 0.0010590363102014118

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

We can see that that 91% of requests have a response size less than 100KB. Try repeating this with 10KB bin sizes and you'll be able to see the spread of response sizes with more granularity.

### Popularity of various image formats

Let's filter out all of the non-Image content and examine the popularity of various image formats. For example, how often is jpg, gif, webp, etc used.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Query">

  ```sql
  /* This query will process 8 GB when run. */
  WITH requests AS (
    SELECT
      STRING(summary.format) AS format,
      page,
      COUNT(0) OVER() AS total_requests,
      COUNT(DISTINCT page) OVER() AS total_pages
    FROM `httparchive.crawl.requests` TABLESAMPLE SYSTEM (1 PERCENT)
    WHERE
      date = '2024-06-01' AND
      client = 'desktop' AND
      is_root_page AND
      type = 'image'
  )

  SELECT
    format,
    COUNT(0) requests,
    COUNT(DISTINCT page) pages,
    ROUND(COUNT(0) / ANY_VALUE(total_requests), 2) percent_image_requests,
    ROUND(COUNT(DISTINCT page) / ANY_VALUE(total_pages), 2) percent_pages
  FROM requests
  GROUP BY format
  ORDER BY requests DESC
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Results">

  format | requests | pages | percent_image_requests | percent_pages
  -- | -- | -- | -- | --
  jpg | 1644804 | 1310081 | 0.38 | 0.43
  png | 1328825 | 1151809 | 0.31 | 0.38
  gif | 793541 | 495055 | 0.18 | 0.16
  svg | 250130 | 227550 | 0.06 | 0.08
  webp | 223783 | 191184 | 0.05 | 0.06
  ico | 64468 | 64016 | 0.01 | 0.02
  avif | 29226 | 25794 | 0.01 | 0.01
  | | 4405 | 3938 | 0.0 | 0.0
  heic | 395 | 382 | 0.0 | 0.0

:::note
It's important to understand the bias in the data when doing this type of analysis. While 1.3 million page views is a very diverse set - the technology used to parse these pages is Chrome browsers (both Desktop and Emulated mobile). Because of this, some formats may be under-represented - since Chrome supports webp but not jpeg-xr or jpeg2000. There may be cases like this with other type of technologies as well - for example custom web font types that vary based on browser support.
