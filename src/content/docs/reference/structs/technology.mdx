_Appears in: [`pages`](/reference/tables/pages/) table_\
_As: [`technologies`](/reference/tables/pages/#technologies)_

Technologies are detected by [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/). Refer to HTTP Archive's fork of the [Wappalyzer repository](https://github.com/HTTPArchive/wappalyzer) on GitHub to request a new technology detection or to browse the source code of existing detections.

## Schema

### `technology`

Type: `STRING`

Name of the detected technology

### `categories`

Type: `ARRAY<STRING>`

List of categories to which this technology belongs

### `info`

Type: `ARRAY<STRING>`

Additional metadata about the detected technology, ie version number

## Example queries

### Pages using WordPress in the top 5k

As the `technologies` field is a repeated struct, we need to use `UNNEST` to query it.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT
  root_page
FROM
  `httparchive.all.pages`,
  UNNEST(technologies) AS t
WHERE
  date = '2023-09-01' AND
  rank = 1000 AND
  t.technology = 'WordPress'
```

### Top 10 CMSs

Within the `technologies` field, the `categories` field is also repeated. We can use `UNNEST` to query it as well.

It's straightforward to detect whether a page uses a technology. However, to generalize that to an entire website (or origin), we detect if either its `root_page` or secondary page use it. To handle this in the query, we count the distinct number of pages' `root_page` fields.

```sql
SELECT
  t.technology AS cms,
  COUNT(DISTINCT root_page) AS sites
FROM
  `httparchive.all.pages`,
  UNNEST(technologies) AS t,
  UNNEST(t.categories) AS category
WHERE
  date = '2023-09-01' AND
  category = 'CMS'
GROUP BY
  cms
ORDER BY
  sites DESC
LIMIT
  10
```

### Top 5 WordPress versions

There is usually only one technology version on a given page, but in some cases a site uses the same technology twice. For example, multiple widgets load different versions of jQuery.

To account for these edge cases, the `info` field is also repeated, so we need to use `UNNEST` to query it as well.

Also note that some pages omit version numbers, so you may see empty or null values in the results.

Regular expressions can be used to parse major version numbers, for example `REGEXP_EXTRACT(version, r'^(\d+)')`. Beware of garbage values, as the version info is extracted from the source HTML. For example, you may encounter a subset of pages with a version number that hasn't even been released yet.

```sql
SELECT
  APPROX_TOP_COUNT(version, 10)
FROM
  `httparchive.all.pages`,
  UNNEST(technologies) AS t,
  UNNEST(t.info) AS version
WHERE
  date = '2023-09-01' AND
  t.technology = 'WordPress'
```
